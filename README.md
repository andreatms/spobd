# Spectral Graph Clustering
#### Signal Processing and Optimization for Big Data Project
---
This project is concerned with the implmentation of an algorithm for spectral graph clustering, a technique used for graph clustering by analyzing its spectral components. 
Specifically, a function for calculating the optimal number of clusters, called Eigengap Heuristic; and a function that goes for graph clustering have been implemented.
